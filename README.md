The goal is to design an effective graph structure and data pipeline to analyze the dataset of moviliens. It contains:
>>>>>>> e1fc14371ee9391438a0199effd8b6c77ae84b83

1. An effective graph structure out of the dataset
2. The design of a data pipeline to ingest the data into the graph database **neo4j** using **python**
3. An API to retrieve individual node in the graph as well as functionality to search the graph
and retrieve the results
