# Evaluation

Thank you for reviewing this project!!

The goal is to design an effective graph structure and data pipeline to analyze the dataset of moviliens. It contains:

1. An effective graph structure out of the dataset
2. The design of a data pipeline to ingest the data into the graph database **neo4j** using **python**
3. An API to retrieve individual node in the graph as well as functionality to search the graph
and retrieve the results
